As an applied philosopher, Alexander explores the nature of reality and civilizational design. His background includes a degree in Media Arts from California College of the Arts and video work at Airbnb. He co-founded Asterisk San Francisco, an arts, culture, and lifestyle print magazine that evolved into The New Asterisk, distributed in 12 countries. He also holds a Master’s degree in Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness from the California Institute of Integral Studies, with a focus on Reality Construction.
A trained spaceholder and medicine server, Alexander is a founding member of House of 42, a faith-based organization that helps individuals and groups, both those healing from trauma and well individuals, move into sovereignty and personal betterment through a proprietary strain of mushroom medicine, protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Alexander coaches founders and creators, weaving and nourishing regenerative ecosystems with consciousness tools, teachings, and by fostering meaningful connections and backing brilliant founders who are helping us transition to a regenerative way of being.
A guiding light for Alexander is an inquiry into the dynamics of consciousness and the creation of a new civilization on planet Earth and beyond.","
For years, I have been slowly shaping the philosophy of MetaTree, at the core of which we find harmonic alignment across scales within which interconnect branching pathways of possibility and structure. MetaTree is an applied and lived philosophy of consciousness, going back to the true origins of philosophy as the love of wisdom and an inquiry into the nature of reality, something alive and vibrant, embodied and felt, relevant to our everyday lives. 

This is why the physical manifestation of this philosophy is a regenesis land project and retreat in Sonoma, California, to implement these inquiries and insights and ground it onto the physical plane. Additionally, I am a weaver, connecting with individuals and networks, making connections, and supporting those who serve with integrity and from the heart. I do this through spaceholding in a coaching capacity, as a medicine server, and through investment. 

In such inquiry, we can discover the necessary tools for our time and I share these tools freely in support of regenerative ecosystems, with a larger vision to seed a new civilization.","
My main need is help with the implementation of MetaTree in its various layers, from the physical structures to the operating system. I’m also looking for other civilizational weavers.

My other need is around structuring my internal ecosystem of ecosystems and leaders, to allow me to scale my offerings to serve more people effectively, as my capacities are currently limited and I have not yet found the ideal way to structure everything on the back end, so in this sense I need help with the foundational structures of my ecosystem and brand, which I have been mostly operating myself.","
Help me create and share the consciousness tools and technologies that empower individuals and communities and enable us to create a MetaTree as an attunement to a harmonic alignment across scales of existence, in sincerity, play and joy.",,

Onboarding Nature is a pioneering endeavour to expand the scope of Nature's Rights, Voice, Vote and Way across governance systems, corporate boards, and any decision-making body. The aim is to foster a global Earth-based/Nature-conscious governance and leadership praxis. The NGA team also supports the co-development of Nature proxies through the Dandelion Fellowship journey (a program for human beings stepping in as representatives of Nature in organizations). Ally first served as a proxy for ""Nature as Director"" on the board of British eco-product company Faith in Nature. She continues to serve as an agent of the Voice, Vote and Way of Nature within diverse organizations and businesses.
Ally is a published legal scholar, with over 20 years’ experience in pedagogical engineering and senior law lecture in HE (UK); a certified Advanced Scrum Master, professional agile & systems facilitator, and Nature Process coach.
Besides her role at ELC, she is also a trustee at RiseUp CIO; an executive member of the Spirituality Scholars Network (SSN-INSS); a professional volunteer at Notre Affaire à Tous (and contributor to “Les Droits de la Nature”); and at Rights & Humanity (International).","
I believe that we create the reality we experience, and that we are alive for the sole purpose of experiencing a beautiful life and world. For these times, I also believe that our mission is to rekindle with the Art of Living joyfully and beautifully, and this requires beautiful sensing, being, thinking and acting. My motto is ‘eunoia through metanoia’. Therefore, I endeavour to cultivate conscious and heart-centred living for the common good. My approach is quantum-based, systemic, integral and holistic, and is embedded in the practice of a psychology of consciousness for ethical decision-making, and aligned being & becoming, behaving, culture and practice. My baseline is the Buddhist 8-fold path: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.
I have been learning and teaching myself this philosophy of life, and practising this theory of change, from as long as I can remember – seeking excellence over the course of my holistic life through the intellectual, psychological, emotional and academic stretching of the whole mind (brain, body and soul). 
My aim is to be of service. I am pretty agile in thinking, be/coming and doing, and I can adjust to the needs of the community. I do not know what the community can learn from me, but I can most heartfully teach what I know about holding space for conscious dreaming, visioning and alignment.","
(Please refer to the Call to Action as well - read together)
Bluntly, the biggest challenge at this stage is financial. The sacred work we do needs fertilising and a caretaking by the wealth gardeners. 

We need resources - logistical, meshworking and more team members (hands on deck); and particularly, we need time and space to do the deep work with clients, within our own organisation, as well as in research, training, and framework development; for evidenced-based proof of concept and handprint reporting. 

Our NGA team has been operating on a pro and low bono basis for the past 12 months. Within that timeframe, we have been powered by our vision, and spared no effort, time and energy to accomplish a lot, including onboarding Nature in several organisations.
Our main challenge is therefore one of providing for our need to be economically held and supported, so that we can continue with our sacred work.","
Together, our team of 3 women works for systemic change, and this requires systemic abilities. Our approach is therefore multilayered, and we cover the following dimensions - which are both objectives and challenges:
a) consciousness: promoting consciousness shift through training, development & educational programs;
b) behavioral: concrete collaborations for transformational impact, with a wide range of organisations, corporations and business. These could be clients, partners and collaborators, including those that are showing the most reticence/resistance to meaningful and deep systemic change (especially if they inflict the most damage on the Earth);
c) cultural: demonstrating the business case that doing good is good both for prosperity and for the Earth. So we promote the 5 Ps: Peace practice for Peoples, Planet, Prosperity and Purpose. The aim here is to cultivate a unified consciousness so that business decisions are made within a Nature-conscious paradigm that is life enhancing (as opposed to the separation paradigm of human vs Nature);
d) systemic: our aim to support economic, social, political, health, education and more systems function within a Nature-conscious paradigm, as part of a whole interconnected organism for the benefits of the Earth community. We therefore promote the rights and voice of Nature for an ecocentric planetary system. 

So, our CTA is as follows: 
- Onboard: Join the community of practice to onboard Nature
- Govern: Cultivate Nature-conscious governance for a regenerative future
- Lead: Practice Nature-conscious leadership to navigate these transformational times
- Invest: Nurture heaven on earth, and join forces with us to make the dream of the Earth a reality. Become a conscious gardener, gift your talent, service and regenerosity",GOVERNANCE,STEWARD

Myopic innovation culture is eating the world. Visionaries don't know how to live, work, or create with wisdom.

This observation has driven a deep exploration of two questions:
1) What does Life on Earth want innovators to learn and practice? [inner development]
2) How do we bring ideas to life in ways that are better for all life? [outer expression]

I think a lot about worldviews and process; how the innovation culture we’ve inherited is violent to self, others, society and ecology. It would suck if all our good intentions wound up causing even more violence to the web of life in the process. How can we together unravel from this dominant paradigm together as a spiritual path home, learning and practicing a more holistic process of bringing paradigm shifting solutions to life, such that we and our processes and our creations exist in right relationship with the web?

The scenarios were built using the method of Science Fiction Prototyping, bringing together science and storytelling. The project includes commissioned artworks by the renowned Swedish conceptual artist Simon Stålenhag. This art-science initiative continues to
create impact and has inspired many to experiment with science fiction prototyping and engage more deeply in the future of the ocean.

In his other role as Science and futures lead at Planethon, Andrew focuses on applying insights from science to support sustainable transformation. Practically, this involves combining science, art, imagination, storytelling and strategy to build futures literacy and transformative capacity within companies & organisations.","
- My theory of change is that science without storytelling will never change the world and telling stories without a solid scientific foundation may change the world but not in a way that any of us want.

- My talent is bringing the power of science and mixing it together with creativity, imagination and storytelling to create impactful experiences that can help us open up and shape our collective futures for the better

- The community can learn how Science Fiction prototyping, blending art and culture with science in creative ways can contribute to systems level innovation and transformation. They can learn that stories aren't just talk but fuel for accelerating the pace of action and guiding us along pathways that are better for people and planet

- I am a systems thinker and think of the global ocean and sustainability science more generally as part of a large interconnected system. to make sense of that system, let alone shape it, we need imagination individually, in our organisations and collectively.

As a co-founder of Listen, alongside Aza Raskin, Eric Lohela, and Chris Larson, we are stewarding 14 acres in the Osa Peninsula into a space where nature and human innovation meet. Listen is a place of awe, inspiration, and a nexus for technology and conservation, where partnerships with conservation leaders are seeded to foster a new way of thinking about our relationship with the earth.

Arjun Verma,https://earthone.world/alliance/arjun-verma,Ali Akbar College of Music,"MUSICIAN--SITARIST, COMPOSER, AND EDUCATOR","San Francisco, CA USA",www.arjun-verma.com,https://www.instagram.com/sitarify,,,"Arjun K. Verma is an internationally acclaimed Indian-American sitarist and composer. Beginning with his father, Roop Verma, and continuing with the legendary Ali Akbar Khan and his son Alam Khan, Arjun’s meticulous training has imbued him with a rich musicality that encompasses both the profound majesty and the exhilaration of North Indian classical music.
Hailed by the New York Times as a “fine sitarist,” Arjun shares the jewels of his cultural heritage in a manner that is fresh, modern, and relevant, while maintaining a high standard of traditional integrity.
Arjun has performed at international venues including the United Nations, the Fillmore, Prague Castle, and on the NBC TV network, collaborating with a diverse host of musicians including the London Symphony Orchestra, Swapan Chaudhuri, Alam Khan, Bob Weir (Grateful Dead), the St. Louis Symphony, and GRAMMY-winning pianist and arranger John Beasley.
Arjun’s performance repertoire has stretched the limits of the sitar as an instrument, and his recording and composing work has applied Indian classical music effectively for TV, opera, and documentary film. In 2023, Arjun published The Resonance Between—a groundbreaking East-West collaboration led by sarodist Alam Khan. The album received international praise, hailed as ""a genuinely revolutionary listening experience” (Cultured Focus); “remarkable. . . simply excellent music” (Popmatters); ""beautiful. . .transcends language, definition, boundaries” (The Hindu);
and was chosen as one of the “Best Albums of 2023” by Songlines Magazine.
Arjun is the recipient of a Mosaic America commissioning grant (2020), a Creative Work Fund grant (2018—Haas Foundation), and a Shenson Fellowship (2007—San Francisco Foundation).","
Systemic change and planet-wide recovery requires us first to restore a deeply-felt sense of interconnectedness and harmony across all levels of experience—from our own bodies, hearts, and minds, to the social and political realms, all the way up to a sense of interdependence with the entire ecological system of Planet Earth. 

Some of the most powerful methods to achieve this are based on traditional arts and practices from our ancient cultures. Indian Classical music is one such potent practice, having evolved through distillation over millennia of the effects of particular musical sounds on the human body, heart, and mind. 

Arjun has spent a lifetime honing this artistic practice, with a particular emphasis on its restorative effects, learning first with his father, Roop Verma, who was not only a sitarist but also an expert on Nada Yoga (traditional sound meditation), and then with the legend Ali Akbar Khan himself, considered by many to be the best musician in the world, particularly renowned for his profound ability to create deeply healing music. Arjun then continued his training with Ali Akbar Khan’s son, Alam Khan—a global ambassador of sarod, recognized internationally as the heir of Ali Akbar Khan’s musical legacy.

Once a felt sense of interconnectedness is nurtured, Arts of all types can then be a means for bringing people together in harmony, and finally can be a medium for amplifying solution-focused messages that emerge from collaborative global problem-solving. 

Arjun has spent decades cultivating not only his ability to be an ambassador of Indian Classical Music, but also building broad skills around technology, cross-cultural collaboration, and environmental change. During a career of several years as a senior product manager at two sustainability and tech firms, Arjun helped build cutting-edge software tools to deliver, quantify and report on sustainability actions at top San Francisco Bay Area firms, and created an early AI optimization, analysis, and communication platform for sales teams on the Salesforce platform.

After retiring from the technology world, Arjun has woven his diverse skill set into his professional music career, using his artistic platform in support of peace-building, humanitarian, and environmental causes, including a performance at the United Nations in Geneva to spread a message of peace at the Forum des Jeunes; numerous benefit concerts and campaigns to support underprivileged education in India, earthquake relief in Nepal, covid-19 relief in India, and indigenous land-back purchases in Colombia.

Arjun has also done many genre-crossing recordings and performances to spread a message of intercultural collaboration and harmony, including an album with multiple GRAMMY-winning jazz artist John Beasley; a collaboration with Alam Khan and Del Sol Quartet on the groundbreaking album, The Resonance Between, chosen by Songlines Magazine as one of the “Best Albums of 2023;” and a forthcoming film using music and animation to spread a message of ecological and personal recovery, healing, hope, and transformation.

Arjun endeavors to offer his gifts to support all three of these stages of change—wielding the potent tool of Indian Classical Music to restore a sense of interconnectedness and well-being; deploying his natural abilities as an intercultural ambassador to facilitate deep collaboration and connection in groups; and finally using his artistic voice to spread the message of powerful solutions to our shared challenges on a global scale.","
The need for long-term project partners to help strategize on, fund, and execute big contemporary projects using music to support global change.

The need for patrons committed to steadily supporting Traditional cultural treasures like Indian Classical Music, in its performance as well as educational contexts.","
The arts are not only at the heart of every culture, but they are essential in the spreading and amplification of key messages to humanity. 

We are in a time where we must pair futuristic technology with traditional wisdom to meet the challenges facing humanity.

The traditional arts, like Indian Classical Music, help us to restore a deep sense of connection and wellbeing both within our personal as well as societal ecosystems. In its contemporary incarnations, this deep music can become a core part of the song of humanity as it seeks to come together to reach a new vision of society.

Support the leveraging of this powerful artistic tool by becoming part of cutting-edge projects to bring this potent music to the world, in any capacity that suits you—as a patron, strategist, producer, technical expert, collaborating artist, or business leader.",,

With nearly two decades in visual media, I bring a deep commitment to transformational storytelling that connects personal growth with social impact. My approach combines a respect for cultural and environmental narratives with a focus on capturing the human spirit in ways that inspire empathy and action. Drawing from extensive experience living among diverse communities and my own journey in personal development, I create stories that resonate authentically and bridge individual transformation with global change.","
Now back in London, I’m seeking sustainable funding to support impactful storytelling locally and internationally, expanding on narratives of cultural preservation and social change. As I navigate the higher production costs here, I’m also looking to partner with producers or business-focused collaborators who shares my vision. Together, we can scale these projects and reach broader audiences with stories that inspire both personal and collective transformation.","
I invite the Earth One Community to collaborate on funding and promoting conscious storytelling projects that honour both local and global narratives. I’m seeking partners and resources to support eco-friendly production practices that minimise environmental impact, particularly for work with remote communities, and welcome insights into sustainable travel and cultural sensitivity. Additionally, I’d love to connect with those who integrate personal development into their professional lives, sharing tools for resilience, grounding, and balance to create impactful, values-aligned work together.",,

His mission in life is to reform human activities, including architecture, design, and human relationships, as they are practiced today from transactional, material-based, consumer pursuits to ones that are transformative, to ones that honors and celebrates the intelligence and generosity of the natural world, and to ones that are deeply collaborative, co-creative and fulfilling for everyone involved.","
My theory of change is that human beings, first and foremost, have an innate drive to want to make the world a better place. And, for the most part, we humans also have viable solutions to today’s pressing challenges. And yet, (and yet!) we are still very much learning how best to work together. 

Accordingly, my unique skills revolved around:

Rapport building - Building intimacy from the outset and continuing to nurture those relationship throughout a project
Ritual - Consciously preparing, opening, abiding, and closing spaces so that all participants can be fully present during a discussion/experience and also leave it behind when we’re complete
Realization/Healing - Deepening our ability to to appreciate, acknowledge, and empower ourselves, and all those around us, including the land that supports us all.","
First, identifying those skill sets that we don't do with ease and grace and finding amazing people who can bring their unique magic and abilities to take on those roles.  Second, deepening our ability to communicate by identifying and learning about new and emergent ways of organizing communications, such as Sociocracy or Holacracy, and committing to learning those systems. And third, funding. We have been self funding most of our projects with gains from our design and contracting businesses, but we definitely have our limitations, both in time and in money. In short, we need funding to bring in more talent to help build the platform and the marketplace.","
My call-to-action to the Earth One Community centers around organizational structures and governance.  How do we create “containers” that optimize our ability to get our core needs met, including connection, contribution, and meaning, while, at the same time, allow for the arising of insights and the ability to act on/manifest those insights in the most optimal ways?",,

I have been working closely with Indigenous Peoples since 2010 in the Amazon Rainforest and have built many relationships built on trust, respect and a profound understanding of the many environmental, cultural, political and socio-economical challenges these communities are facing and will face in the coming decade. The Indigenous have given me a name, the Toucan :)) And when asked why, I was told, I have the ability to track potential dangers coming and like a Toucan, and I alert them before the danger comes. I believe my unique ability is to foresee and anticipate plausible futures over the next 10 to 15 years, using scenario planning as one of my main tools. A strategic tool developed by the American army to make wars that I love to apply to design more sustainable and regenerative futures in order to prevent the further environmental contamination of the rainforest and the health of its Indigenous communities. As an architect, I love developing sustainable models that can be replicated and scaled and I have applied this process of thinking to develop an Indigenous-Led Rainforest Conservation Model that seeks to protect some of the most biodiverse areas on our planet and the largest population of Uncontacted communities in the world who defend it, unifying 9 different Indigenous Peoples behind this project.","
The biggest challenge I face on my mission is to change the culture in the nature conservancy sector and large non profit organizations dominated by the international trust fund model for landholding. This model often fails to prevent mining and deforestation. And to help implement a paradigm shift toward recognizing and restoring ancestral lands to Indigenous Peoples.  Indigenous communities have proven to be the most effective stewards of these lands, safeguarding them against exploitation and preserving primary forests. At the heart of this challenge, lies bridging trust between Indigenous Peoples and funders who fear that their contributions might be not serve their intent to ensure long term conservation.","
As we enter, phase 2 of our Indigenous Led Rainforest Conservation Initiative, we intend to support the creation of an Indigenous Federation that will hold all 14 endangered biodiversity hotspots we have identified and have been monitoring in collaboration with the University of São Paulo, the Global Institute for Peace, and several Indigenous organizations in Brazil. We are seeking to create a healthy, sovereign Indigenous organization that will be led by Indigenous leaders, elders, representatives and institutions from 9 different Peoples. I am hoping that the One Earth community will help weave, connect and foster the right alliances and support needed to accomplish this task so that together we can protect some of the most biodiverse areas on earth and the largest population of Uncontacted Communities in the world.",BIOCULTURES,FELLOW

Recognized globally for his passion and excellence in photography, this photographer-cum-activist could not resist the call to activism after witnessing first-hand the brutality that disadvantaged Kenyans experienced in the wake of the Post- Election Violence in 2008. He then established Picha Mtaani a traveling photography exhibition telling of the violence.
The travelling photo exhibition toured across Kenya and drew more than 2 million people.- The tour of the exhibition offered a platform for individual reflection, honest dialogue, interpersonal healing and community reconciliation.
In 2012 Boniface founded PAWA254, a hub for creatives in Kenya where journalists, artists and activists find innovative ways of achieving social change.
At 40, he has been a guest of the state on many occasions for championing justice and calling out powerful leaders for their wanton corruption and blatant violation of human rights. This has earned him friends and foes alike. His commitment to promote social change has also come at a heavy price. As a husband and father, his wife and children have endured hostilities from different quarters. The escalation of these hostilities has seen him being threatened with harm and/or death by powerful forces in government.
Like many Kenyans with a challenging upbringing where basic needs were not always met, Boniface Mwangi is all too familiar with the struggles of the ordinary Kenyan. He has worked as a bus-park sweeper, house-boy and hawker. He even served time in Approved School.
Despite monumental odds, he has risen, discovering photography at a young age and applying his entrepreneurial brilliance to break free from the clutches of poverty. Those who have worked with Boniface Mwangi can attest to his diligence, compassion and self-drive.
He has twice won the CNN Multichoice Africa Photojournalist of the Year Award and is the youngest Prince Claus Laureate. New African Magazine named him one of the 100 Most Influential Africans of 2014, 2016 and 2020 and he is also a senior TED Fellow. Time magazine recognized him as a Next Generation Leader in 2015 and was selected as Kenya’s Top 40 under 40 men 2016. He was named as top 100 Kenyans 2019 and 2020. He was the recipient of Luxembourg Peace Prize 2020/21 awarded Schengen Peace Foundation and Luxembourg Peace Prize. He is also a Tutu Fellow.
Boniface Mwangi continues to wage a spirited campaign against oppressive establishments. Although at one point he stood alone, today his movement has gained traction with many – inspired by his vision and consistency – adding their voices to champion for a better Kenya.
Boniface and his wife Njeri Mwangi are the loving parents of 3 adorable children.
He is the author of Unbounded – a poignant and riveting memoir that captures his incredible journey.","
My theory of change is rooted in the conviction that a more equal, just, and humane world is possible. I believe when people are empowered, they can stand up, and fight for their rights, and dignity. I have led movements, and protests in Kenya that transformed my country for the better. 
Through my award-winning photojournalism, book, communications, and reach of 3 million plus l can influence positive social, and political change through an engaged, and informed citizenry by highlighting truths, injustices, and calls to action. 
I collaborate with all sectors - legal, grassroots, professional, pan-African, international, NGOs & CSOs, artists and creatives, communities, individuals, and beyond to build on a multi-faceted approach to continue bringing positive change in our country, and Africa.","

Brave Media leverages its key platform, ‘Sema Ukweli’ (Speak The Truth) which is an integrated online and social media platform encompassing: a YouTube Channel (the anchor platform) supported by a: Website, X, and Facebook and WhatsApp platforms. Brave Media through the “Sema Ukweli” media platform has cut a niche in exposing human rights abuses and social injustices across the country to advocate for a just and free country.
2 - Kenya Ni Kwetu was founded among Kenyan revolutionaries to enable a patriotic citizens’ movement to take bold and effective actions in building a new Kenya. Our vision is a united and empowered multi-generational society collaborating to inspire social and political change. 

•⁠  ⁠⁠Mental wellness, trauma recovery, and healing.

Her dedication to continuous learning and skill acquisition is exemplified by her development of “Everon: The Eternal Game,” a conceptual framework that views life as a multi-level game aimed at personal growth and planetary salvation. This framework not only informs her creative projects but also underpins the music she releases with her duo, All Yours.
In addition to her creative pursuits, Caity possesses a robust background in the music industry, having worked as a music producer, singer/songwriter, DJ, video artist, and creative development for film and television.

As a multifaceted technologist, developer, designer, global systems thinker, artist, and musician, dedicated to harnessing the power of immersive and deep technologies to enhance human experiences and drive societal progress. 

My niche is at the intersection of global systems mapping, analysis, and design, communication, and multi-platform / mixed format XR UX / experience design for entertainment, education and beyond that aim to maximize engagement and impact. 

In my masters program, I dived deeply into spatial experience and spatial cognition, and the principles of gamification, applying principles of games and play to non-gaming contexts, and how to mindfully and gamefully design experiences that encourage participation in meaningful and rewarding ways for users. 

I’ve also developed my artist music concept around global change and personal development and created easy on-ramps into deeper sociosystemic topics by framing the music and world building experience as an MMORPG Eternal Game of life, inspired by the concepts of The Infinite Game and the Great Game.","

On the back end, it’s important to show developers and designers what is now possible and becoming increasingly possible with emerging technologies so talented builders am an start architecting new systems and tools for better brighter futures, and on the front end, it’s about developing small and engaging touch points that make audiences/users realize that they have the power to envision possible futures and participate in numerous low-lift ways to bring these futures to life.",,

She views music & movement as sacred expressions of a universal language; a language that unites and empowers people from all backgrounds.
As a musician and movement artist she values expression as a path to awakening; a gateway to exploring the different parts of ourselves, the light & the shadow, exploring duality as a path to unity.
Her songs are encoded in prayers for the earth and for humanity. Themes of sacred sensuality, earth reverence, collective healing, soil regeneration, and divine feminine awakening linger in her lyrics. Her work is often inspired by our collective narrative as well as her own personal journey of connecting deeper to one’s truest self by dropping the false stories that we’ve been told; that by releasing our conditioning we step into a greater place of potential & activation.
As a self-described “Rising-Gemini with ADHD” she is lover of many varieties of music & interplays with genres from Downtempo, Tantric Pop, and Deep House to Mystical Bass.
While currently putting the final touches on her live set, she also has an unstoppable affection for Deep Sultry House music which she plays for hybrid DJ sets solo and with her side project, her deepening affection for the genre has led her to performing at festivals and venues opening for legends like Acid Pauli, Goldcap, Marques Wyatt, and more.
Mystifying to categorize, her music is often described as deep, sultry, and sacred. Her voice a bridge to ethereal realms, unparalleled but reminiscent of Kate Bush, FKA Twigs, & Deya Dova.
Arula has performed & facilitated at a multitude of venues & festivals (Oregon Eclipse, Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle, Serenity) and has co-produced experiential events such as Sensual (NOVA/Heather Christie), Pulse (Mezzanine SF/Jeremy Falk Yoga), Moon Medicine & more.

Claudia Comte,https://earthone.world/alliance/claudia-comte,Studio Claudia Comte,ARTIST,"Switzerland, Basel",www.claudiacomte.ch,https://www.instagram.com/claudiacomte/?hl=en,,,"Claudia Comte (b. 1983, Grancy) is a Swiss artist based in Basel, Switzerland. Working across site-specific
installation, painting and sculpture, her practice is guided by a longstanding interest in teasing out the
history and memory of biomorphic forms through traditional hand processes, industrial and machine
technologies. At the heart of Comte’s installations are monumental wall paintings and serial sculptures
inspired by organic patterns and morphology such as waves, sonar, cacti and rock strata, that are playfully
recomposed within fluid and immersive environments. Drawing on the powers of communication, knowledge
and symbiosis between animal and plant life, Comte’s dynamic and shape-shifting objects pay testament to
the intelligence and transformative capacities of the ecological world.","

What’s your niche and function in the impact ecosystem?
I am a visual artist, who works at the intersection of art, environmental action, and community
engagement, using painting, sculptures, and large-scale environmental installations to spark
awareness about ecology, biodiversity, and the complexities of the Anthropocene.
My studio in the Swiss countryside is a core part of my practice, nestled on a fully off-grid property
where my partner, Samuel Leuenberger, also has an art space. Powered by solar energy and
equipped with its own water and waste systems, our home operates independently. We grow our
food following permaculture principles, working with the natural rhythms of the land.
This space also naturally lends itself to learning and collaboration, and we often welcome artists,
scientists, and community members to experience a sustainable approach to living and creating.
Visitors can see how my work is influenced by this direct connection with nature, from observing
local biodiversity to working with locally sourced materials. The studio offers a quiet example of
how sustainable practices can support creative work and bring ecological values into the flow of
everyday life.

What is your theory of change?
My theory of change is grounded in the belief that art can create meaningful, experiential
connections, that engage people emotionally, shifting perspectives on environmental issues.
Through the use of poetry, metaphor, and a direct connection to material, art draws us toward
something beyond ourselves, encouraging lateral thinking and oblique connections. By using
organic materials and natural forms with digital and traditional processes, and exploring themes of
regeneration, biodiversity, and climate resilience, I aim to cultivate an appreciation for the non-
human world, using art as a bridge to broaden understanding.

What’s your unique skill, experience, or talent?
As a visual artist, I bring a background in material-based processes—particularly in wood, large-
scale wall painting, and marble—and work to transform these elements into immersive
environments within public spaces, such as museums, institutions, galleries, and outdoor
community projects. Collaborating closely with scientists, environmentalists, and activists has also
deeply enriched my practice, allowing me to integrate scientific insights and address ecological
concerns from a unique perspective.

What can our community learn from you?
I hope to share with the community how creative processes can enhance traditional approaches to
environmental awareness and contribute to a transformative dialogue about our shared
responsibilities to the planet.
I would like to give a presentation on my practice and particularly the collaborative underwater
sculpture park project I have been working on with TBA21-Academy and Alligator Head
Foundation, where I created a series of underwater sculptures designed to foster marine
biodiversity. This work was part of an ongoing effort to combine art with ecological restoration,
specifically by creating structures that support coral growth and provide habitat for marine life.","
What is the biggest challenge(s) you face in your work to achieve your mission?
- A key challenge is the limited engagement and awareness many audiences have around climate
change. I often encounter a lack of interest or understanding, making it difficult to connect
people to the urgency of environmental action. It seems many feel either removed from the issue
or simply uninformed, and overcoming this disengagement remains a significant hurdle.
- Adding to this, the sheer volume of information on climate change and biodiversity loss often
results in ""environmental fatigue,"" where audiences tune out or feel overwhelmed.
- Producing large-scale installations that have both aesthetic and environmental integrity is a
resource-intensive process, and I am continually seeking sustainable solutions to address this.
- Another concern is accessibility: ensuring that my works environmental messages resonate
beyond the confines of the traditional art world to engage a broader, more diverse audience.
- I also seek opportunities to collaborate with scientists, activists, and investors who can support
the production and reach of my work.","
- Partnerships to integrate art-based environmental education into broader public and academic
initiatives.
- Assistance in broadening the representation and visibility of my work would be invaluable, this
would allow me to engage new audiences.
- I hope to connect with scientists and activists whose insights can deepen the impact of my
projects, fostering collaborations that enrich my understanding and approach.
- I am interested in meeting investors who share a commitment to environmental sustainability
and can help bring large-scale, eco-conscious art projects to fruition.",,

I have nearly twenty years of experience as a synthetic biologist, movement builder, educator, designer, and artist. In that time, I have explored three theories of change that are each foundational to my work: first, a technical theory of change: what are transformative tools and technologies that can help change the world? As a synthetic biologist, I have pioneered the development of “lab-on-a-chip” devices for gene synthesis and genetic circuit assembly, organ-on-a-chip technologies (including artificial guts for prototyping microbial communities and artificial noses for augmented olfactory sensing), and am currently working on establishing a global cloud laboratory of liquid-handling robots to enable radically accessible learning and creativity in the life sciences. 

Second, a social theory of change: how can we empower communities and build movements that confer agency and power? For nearly fifteen years I served as founder and director of EMW Community Space, a community center in Cambridge, MA that served thousands of community members from marginalized backgrounds through art and technology programming. I am the founder of the Global Community Bio Summit, the annual movement event that brings together the global network of grassroots, community-led biology labs. Over the years we have worked with thousands of participants from more than 100 countries to co-design statements of shared purpose, codes of ethics, and governance frameworks. I am also co-inventor of the ‘Supermind Design’ methodology, a collective intelligence framework for designing more effective communities and other organizations.  

Third, a relational theory of change: how can we shift our underlying values and worldviews from extractive, utilitarian approaches to ones of mutualism and reciprocity, particularly with nature? I teach the MIT graduate course ""Ancient Future Technology,"" where we explore how cutting-edge technologies like AI and synthetic biology can actualize worldviews where the natural world is our family and ancestors, instead of resources to be exploited. I am also working on a ‘Living Artifacts’ project, where we are developing novel biomaterials like bacterial bio cements to fabricate artifacts that we hope will impact our relationship with the materials of our environment. 

I have been integrating each of these three theories of change into a new design framework I have been developing called ‘Biotic Design,’ which explores the technical, social, and relational dimensions of designing with the living world. A major ‘Biotic Design’ project I am working on now involves eco-augmentation and deploying both technical and social innovations for coral conservation applications (e.g. coral probiotics for enabling temperature and disease resilience), with a current case study in Mo’orea. I am also helping to lead the visioning and establishment of a global ‘ECO-ARPA,’ which aims to develop novel eco-augmentation technologies that could help address some of our pressing ecosystem challenges. I would love to discuss any and all of these projects with colleagues on Earth One and explore how to collaborate, synergize, and amplify our collective work!

Finally, I also love DJing (especially for nerds), and have performed as a DJ, beat-boxer, vocalist, and rapper at hundreds of venues, and teamed up with hip hop icon DJ Jazzy Jeff to make ‘Biota Beats’ from the human microbiome. My research and photography has also been exhibited at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian and in other museums and galleries around the world.","

In my experience, technical innovations alone are not enough to change the world, and even large-scale movements, while effective at realizing change, still need to be grounded in truly transformative values and worldviews.

Unfortunately, much of the same AI tech for good that folks like me helped pioneer is instead being deployed in social media, recommendation, search, chatbot, and newsfeed algorithms in ""post-truth"" ways that amplify and harden unconscious biases, misunderstandings, fearmongering, hatred, polarization, politicization, demonization, and dehumanization.
My theory of change is that we can only move the politicians and executives by first moving the public, as I did in our wildly successful media campaign for Covid universal masking.
I am using the voice I'm privileged to have as an AI pioneer to shine bright light upon the existentially dangerous unconscious ways that AIs are sapping our social will on all the SDGs, and to built a movement to demand that AI algorithms stop dragging us into a new AI Dark Ages and instead to become the catalyst for a new AI Age of Englightment.","
Honestly: funding. I'm the last of my peer level to have consistently declined all the lucrative opportunities from big tech, because I know they would silence me on these challenges as they have my colleagues there. The amounts needed are small by Silicon Valley standards, but my academic income alone is not enough to self-finance the scale of media communications and R&D required to overcome heavy systemic resistance.","

Theory of Change: Local, indigenous & traditional wisdom
Hundreds of thousands of communities and cultures around the globe live interconnected with nature. By exchanging knowledge, and growing relationships rooted in reciprocity we can cultivate powerful networks of solidarity.       Understanding human behavior: Social science confirms that emotions dominate our decision making and that we have a fundamental need for connection and belonging. This is true of our relationships with our communities and the Earth. 
 Catalyzing partnerships: There are constellations of creative and disruptive endeavors around the world determined to shift our cultural narrative. By aligning and amplifying these efforts we will transform individual and collective beliefs and actions.

I focus on engaging people in participatory experiences that open new pathways for collaboration and connection. If you want to chat about experience design, including how to make events more immersive and engaging by avoiding content that could just as well be on YouTube, I’d love to talk. 

I have also deeply studied network governance at Burning Man and can provide perspective on network design from the standpoint of a network that is four decades into experimenting with the paradox between emergence and organization.","
I am seeking to connect with people who can advise on participatory governance models that might be able to work at some degree of scale. Burning Man is a relatively fractal ecosystem full of groups of all different sizes and needs. We need to figure out who should have a voice in shaping where the Burning Man event, organization, and culture goes from here, and how we might best implement new forms of decision making in a post-founder era. 

I am also interested generally in hearing from anyone who has thoughts on the future of Burning Man, how it could be most impactful as a cultural force in the world, what could and should change in the way Burning Man Project operates, and how we may continue to be bold in imagining what is next for this unique cultural force.","
I dedicate myself to Burning Man because I believe it creates the conditions where people can have an embodied experience of a new paradigm, one that operates (in some ways) on alternate economic logic, and relies deeply on collaborative effort to rise from the dust. 

I believe that the energy and resource expenditure that goes into Burning Man is only justifiable to the degree that it provides the platform for imagining the world anew, and prototyping the kind of world that we would like to live in. What will it take for Burning Man to more deeply embody the principles it espouses? How might we evolve this movement to meet the moment we are in today, and toward which the world is headed?

Bio
Chico Araújo, Ph.D., is an anthropologist, futurist, systems thinker, and impact catalyst, with over two decades of experience at the crossroads of exponential technologies, innovative financial and business models, and anthropological insights.
As the founder of Beyond Tomorrow, Chico advises organizations on strategy, foresight, innovation, and social impact. He specializes in integrating human and machine intelligences and new consensus mechanisms (leveraging AI and blockchain) across multiple stakeholders and diverse cultural frameworks to drive transformation in business, finance, sustainability, and social prosperity. One of his key initiatives, developed with the Instituto Rever, involves creating regenerative metrics based on indigenous worldviews in collaboration with 14 indigenous communities in Acre, supported by the Amazon Fund – this initiative have the potential to develop into something even bigger, a catalyst for connecting indigenous groups globally and hacking western paradigm into regeneration.
Chico is also a co-founder of The Long Game, a Futuretainment project aimed at counter-colonizing the collective Western imagination by developing immersive experiences that allow people to envision alternative futures. The first concept introduced was BioSingularity, exploring the intersection of technology, biology, and consciousness, to envision a future where human systems integrate with nature’s intelligence.
Renowned for his ability to bridge diverse social groups, Chico is passionate about unlocking the untapped potential of individuals and organizations through knowledge, skills, mindsets, and tools. Throughout his career, he has led and implemented conflict resolution programs and complex negotiations, engaging with multinational corporations, local governments, universities, financial institutions, foundations, NGOs, and grassroots communities—consistently promoting social prosperity and organizational innovation.
Chico served as Senior Head of Futures, Innovation Strategy, and Open Innovation at Santander Brazil, where he led teams to identify trends, develop future scenarios, and restructure major operations to foster financial innovation. At Viva Rio, as Chief Innovation Officer, he spearheaded transformative initiatives like the Favela Hub—an innovation center supporting entrepreneurship in marginalized communities—and launched the Viva Primeira Infância program, focusing on early childhood development alongside various initiatives in education, health, environment, and human security.
As a senior researcher at the Public Policy Analysis Directorate (DAPP) at FGV, Chico also served as an innovation consultant for FGV Projetos, contributing to policy development across several governmental initiatives. He directed pivotal research on the evaluation and mitigation of socio-environmental impacts on indigenous communities for the Jirau Hydroelectric Plant. Chico was also a collaborating expeditionary for the Genographic Project Brazil, a National Geographic initiative mapping human migration through mitochondrial DNA analysis. His hands-on work with indigenous groups includes experiences with Kaxarari, Oro-Wari, Uru-eu-wau-wau, Amondawa, Kayapó, Xavante, Baniwa, Tariano, Wanano, Desana, Dâw, Hupda, Guarani, and Kaingang.
Chico has been a guest lecturer for the Global MBA in Business Management and other MBA programs at IBMEC, as well as for the Leadership, Innovation and 4.0 Management and Digital Transformation and Future of Business MBAs at PUC-RS and UoL EdTech. He has lectured at prestigious institutions, including the Global Solutions Program at Singularity University, the Prince of Wales Business and Sustainability Programme at Cambridge University, and the 20th Latin American Conference at MIT Sloan School of Management.
Academically, Chico holds a Ph.D. in History of Science and Technology & Epistemology from UFRJ, a Master’s in Social Anthropology from the Museu Nacional-UFRJ, a Master’s in International Business Management from the Université Pierre Mendès-France/IAE-Grenoble, and an MBA in Marketing from IAG/PUC-RJ. He is a graduate of the Singularity University’s Graduate Studies Program, supported by a full scholarship from Google. He has also completed the Environmental and Resource Economics Training Course in Impact Evaluation through LACEEP and the Executive Leadership in Early Childhood Development program at Harvard University.
Chico’s career is defined by his ability to connect diverse perspectives and intelligences to foster collaboration across sectors. His leadership is rooted in building bridges between corporations, communities, governments, and grassroots organizations, always striving to combine cultural knowledge with cutting-edge technologies to address complex societal challenges. He firmly believes that addressing emerging global challenges requires mobilizing humanity’s cultural heritage and harmonizing traditional wisdom with the exploration of new possibilities created by exponential technologies.
Chico is deeply invested in meta-learning strategies and continually explores new fields of knowledge as challenges emerge, always approaching them with a beginner's mindset and a commitment to continuous growth.
Outside of his professional life, Chico is a dedicated practitioner of Tibetan Buddhist meditation and is currently navigating the transformative journey of fatherhood with his daughter, Malu.","
Niche & Function in the Impact Ecosystem:

I operate at the intersection of exponential technologies, financial innovation, and indigenous wisdom. My role bridges multiple sectors—corporations, governments, research institutions, NGOs, and grassroots communities—to create regenerative and desirable futures. I aim to align technology with ancestral knowledge to drive transformative change, or as I like to describe it, “hacking” legal structures, financial models, and business frameworks into regenerative and prosperous futures.

Theory of Change:

True systemic change will occur when modern technological innovations are integrated with ancient cultural cosmovisions, fostering systems that are regenerative, equitable, and abundant.

Unique Skills/Expertise:

Extensive experience with indigenous and grassroots communities: Integrating their knowledge systems into impactful social and environmental projects.
Multidisciplinary expertise: Drawing from anthropology, history of science, and financial innovation.
Strategic leadership: Proven success in connecting diverse stakeholders and cultural frameworks.
Expertise in futures and systems thinking: Applying strategic foresight and systems design to drive meaningful transformation.

What the Community Can Learn from Me:

Insights on creating systemic impact and regeneration by integrating diverse stakeholder perspectives and worldviews.
Practical perspectives on merging emerging technologies with ancestral wisdom to build regenerative, future-oriented systems.
Co-creating diegetic prototypes, immersive narratives, and rituals to boost imagination, problematize existing systems, and/or facilitate change.
Using dreams and mythic imagination as tools to create emotional pacts, shared symbols, and collective visions that facilitate transformative change.

Support for Expanding Projects to Brazil: Guidance on how to adapt and scale projects to the Brazilian context, navigating its unique regulatory, cultural, and environmental landscapes, and connecting with relevant stakeholders for meaningful impact.","
Lack of Community and Support in Brazil: Finding a network that fully embodies and advocates for regeneration and systemic change (from the inside-out) can be challenging, limiting the potential for coalition-building and the momentum needed for transformational projects.

Access to Cutting-Edge Technology Developers: Limited access to skilled developers in key technologies, such as AI and blockchain, slows the integration of advanced solutions that are crucial for systemic change.

Global Scalability: Building a global partner network is essential for expanding the project's impact. This requires identifying stakeholders who share the commitment and can help connect, adapt, and scale these initiatives across different regions.","
We do not need to invent, out of thin air, new models of sociability that harmonize with sustainability and regeneration—these systems already exist, deeply embedded in the ways of life of over 476 million indigenous people across more than 5,000 distinct groups worldwide, representing roughly 6.2% of the global population, according to the United Nations and Amnesty International. These communities play a vital role in preserving 80% of the planet’s biodiversity while occupying just 25% of the world's surface. For millennia, they have mastered the art of living in balance with their ecosystems, preserving biodiversity, and nurturing regenerative relationships with nature.
Just as the Renaissance rediscovered the philosophical wisdom of Ancient Greece, breathing new life into Western thought, we now need an Indigenous Renaissance—a revival of indigenous wisdom that can guide us toward regenerative futures. The task ahead is not only to connect these countless worldviews, but to strengthen their mutual connections and find creative ways to infuse the Western paradigm with these essential principles of coexistence, preservation, and regeneration. Indigenous models are not simply survival mechanisms; they represent holistic systems for human flourishing, encompassing the social, environmental, and spiritual dimensions of life.
By bridging ancestral knowledge with exponential technologies, we can build on centuries of wisdom about sustainable living and regenerative practices, offering crucial pathways to combat both environmental and societal crises. This process allows us to reimagine modern systems through the lens of harmony with nature—where innovation is not about domination, but about regeneration.
I call upon the Earth One Community to join me in this mission. Let us collaborate to merge diverse knowledge systems, facilitate the exchange of regenerative practices, and integrate these insights into Western structures—whether through new financial models, consensus mechanisms, or collaborative technologies like. Together, we can co-create a world where economies, social systems, and legal frameworks work to regenerate both human communities and the planetary ecosystems that sustain us.",INTELLIGENCES,FELLOW

My aspiration is to continually contribute to the conscious evolution on both individual and collective levels to create harmony, sustainability, and unity. I believe in a world where humanity acts as a unified entity in support of the planet.
With an MSc in Civil Engineering, my original career began in infrastructures and engineering. After working as the Director of Commercial Development for various infrastructural design firms during the early years following my graduation, I founded SECTA MONITORING. This startup develops fiber optic sensing technologies for diverse applications in automotive, infrastructures, renewable energy, oil and gas, aerospace and much more.
The startup aims take its clients to a deeper level of knowledge and deliver accurate information that can support them improving performance and safety monitoring the health state of structures, infrastructures and components involved in engineering projects, but also monitoring risky and complicated processes across a variety of industries - enabling predictive maintenance and early warnings in case of potential dangers.
While I am still the CEO of Secta, I have also established a new company that resonates more with my spiritual growth—Supera Jewels. This jewellery brand crafts bespoke tools for conscious practice and personal evolution. Our products are designed around the client’s intentions, meaningfully enriched with personal details and meticulously sourced materials and crystals to anchor the desired energy. We deliver our pieces through ceremonies and experiences specifically customized to evoke beneficial emotions and promote energetic balance.
Besides offering bespoke jewels and experiences, we organize collective retreats and events that allow participants to align with our worldview and explore various practices. I find it fascinating how both gemstones and fiberglass in my work serve as carriers of light and information due to their crystalline properties. I am also eager to continue expanding my fields of activity and exploring new paths aligned with my interest in influencing human consciousness to promote healing and evolution by raising levels of self and collective awareness.","
Regarding Supera Jewels, our aim is to leverage the power of “cueing” in bespoke fashion and the relational association with emotionally charged experiences to aid our clients in developing a conscious practice which involves increasing levels of awareness about themselves and the selves they aspire to be. In this way we encourage and support the clients on their path of growth, self improvement and spiritual development, by therapeutically getting them closer to their true nature. Our second goal is to deepen the research and our understanding on crystals as natural technologies and discover sustainable ways to integrate them into our life.

In my engineering work, the impact of my team and company on the ecosystem is centered on researching and integrating innovative solutions for achieving 0% carbon emissions in energy production for engineering projects (INCO ENGINEERING). Additionally, we focus on preserving existing infrastructure and structural assets and reducing risk by monitoring industrial processes (SECTA MONITORING).","

Jessica Linde,https://earthone.world/alliance/jessica-linde,Felt Sense,ENERGY & SOMATIC HEALER & EMBODIMENT COACH,"Cape Town, South Africa",www.feltsensesomatics.com,https://www.instagram.com/jessjlinde/,,Israel,,"
In the impact ecosystem, my work exists at the intersection of somatic healing, neuroscience, and mysticism, emphasizing women’s embodiment, empowerment, and sexual & self-liberation. My theory of change is that by aligning individuals to their core essence and fostering Love Consciousness, we unlock transformative ripples through communities and the planet. I bring a unique blend of trauma-informed energetic activation, neurobiological awareness, and mystical practice, guiding others to deepen their connections within and expand outward. This integration of ancient wisdom and modern science offers our community profound insights into personal and collective healing.","
One of the biggest challenges I face in my work is bridging the gap between scientific understanding and holistic healing in a way that resonates with a broader audience. The world is still catching up to integrating neuroscience with somatic and energetic practices, so I often face resistance or skepticism from those unfamiliar with this synthesis. Additionally, building sustainable community support systems that maintain the momentum of healing and empowerment work is challenging, as this requires both time and deeply committed resources.
A significant challenge in my work is navigating a social culture that promotes a lifestyle centered on constant consumption and superficial ideals, often touted as the “dream life.” Many people numb themselves through various means, from substances to material distractions, to escape from deeper truths and emotions. This cultural narrative makes it challenging to encourage authentic healing and self-discovery, as it requires individuals to break away from conditioned behaviors that don’t serve their well-being or the collective good. 

Another challenge is overcoming the limited accessibility to holistic and transformative healing practices, particularly in underserved communities. Resources are often scarce, and many people who would benefit most are either unaware of these tools or lack access. Additionally, shifting deeply ingrained beliefs around self-worth and empowerment requires a supportive environment that many may not have, making it harder to create lasting impact. Balancing the need for sustainable income with making these practices widely accessible is also an ongoing challenge.","
To help overcome these challenges, I invite the Earth One Community to collaborate in making holistic healing more accessible and understood. By sharing resources, creating awareness campaigns, and connecting diverse communities to these transformative practices, we can bridge the gap between modern lifestyles and the deeper healing needed. Supporting initiatives that make these practices available to underserved areas, while promoting a shift from numbing behaviors to genuine self-care, will empower more individuals to reconnect with themselves and the Earth in meaningful ways.

Here’s a refined version of your response that maintains the tone of a future world leader:

I believe one of my greatest strengths lies in my intuition and my ability to harness it to achieve both my goals and those of others, while fostering connections that redefine the concept of serendipity. I do this with the clear intention of creating enormous positive impact in the world.

My long-term vision is to serve my country at the highest level, and in the immediate future, I plan to dedicate my efforts to causes that have broad, bipartisan support. I firmly believe in bridging divides—both within my country and across the world—and I am committed to working toward a future where unity prevails over division. In an ideal world, one that I believe is attainable, we will overcome the precarious divides that challenge us today.","

My call to action for this community, and for all those connected to it, is straightforward yet powerful: Let us come together to design a future that is both ideal and attainable, and hold ourselves accountable to achieving our collective goals—no matter how ambitious or how many obstacles we encounter along the way. Too often, people gather for brief conferences and return to their routines, leaving ideas behind. I am confident that this journey will be different.

Now a citizen of the UK, New Zealand, and Canada, John lives in Montréal with his wife and teenage daughter, always inspired by the vision of a regenerative world.","
My focus is on entrepreneurial impact. I build investment platforms and nurturing ecosystems that connect and guide entrepreneurs who are driven to make large-scale, positive change in the world. I believe that the success of ideas and teams is a direct reflection of the consciousness of their creators and leaders. This is why founders must invest in the development of their own consciousness even before they develop their products and companies. My work, therefore, revolves around helping entrepreneurs expand their awareness and vision as they strive to create companies that are deeply impactful.","
The biggest challenge I face is raising aligned capital. Too often, investors—whether managing their own capital or that of others—are conditioned to view their role solely through the lens of generating financial returns. They often see legal, ethical, or impact considerations as someone else’s responsibility, either upstream or downstream from their work. The challenge is to shift the mindset of investors, helping them realize the importance of embedding a planetary and societal benefit filter at the forefront of their decision-making, before financial returns are considered. It’s this shift in consciousness that is crucial to aligning capital with the transformative change we seek to foster.","
To truly transform the role of capital, entrepreneurship, and technology in fostering social cohesion and addressing planetary degradation, we need a committed group of aligned investors.

I invite the Earth One Community to help us bring together this core group of investors who are prepared to support the development of entrepreneurial leaders with a new level of consciousness. This begins with the creation of a human development school, where emerging founders will experience a consciousness shift—a reorientation of their thinking towards holistic, systemic impact—before they go on to build transformational companies.

Our immediate need is the financial backing to establish this entrepreneurial development school, followed by investment capital to fund the catalyzing ventures these graduates will create. This will set the foundation for a new era of entrepreneurship, one that aligns capital with deep societal and planetary impact.",,

With four decades in advertising, I’ve founded around 20 different companies across 7 countries, including ventures like Grupo Tribu, which became Havas Tribu, Bosz Digital, and Darwin Zone. I hold an MBA from INCAE and a Global MBA from Georgetown University and Esade Barcelona. Now, after letting go of all my companies and positions, my focus is on sharing what I’ve learned through writing, mentorship, and collaboration, always aiming to spark change and new ideas. You can read more of my thoughts and reflections on my blog at jorgeoller.com.","
My theory of change is grounded in intentional serendipity—seizing opportunities rather than relying on luck. By letting go of rigid ideas and control, we create space for innovation and growth. I believe change requires a sense of urgency, and effective communication is key to fostering that urgency. It’s through this balance of detachment and urgency that real transformation happens.

I possess a unique ability to balance both structure and spontaneity in a professional context. Drawing from my extensive background in advertising and entrepreneurship, I’ve learned to harness creativity while adhering to goals. My strength lies in recognizing when to push boundaries and when to pull back, combining strategy with a flair for innovation. Also, my experiences from writing El Arte del Desapego taught me the value of letting go in order to foster creativity and adaptability, whether in campaigns, teams, or my own personal journey.

I excel at balancing structure with spontaneity. As a serial entrepreneur with extensive experience in advertising, I’ve learned how to combine strategy with creativity, knowing when to push boundaries and when to pull back. Writing El Arte del Desapego reinforced the value of letting go to foster innovation and adaptability in both personal and professional life.

The community can learn the power of detachment—not from goals, but from rigid ideas and fears. With deep experience in creating Lovemarks, I understand how to build emotional connections that foster loyalty beyond reason. My journey shows that embracing uncertainty leads to transformation. I offer insights on creating peak performing teams and an inspirational space for serendipity, building emotional bonds, and driving growth with urgency.","
Having stepped away from traditional positions of influence and power, my challenge is finding new ways to create change. My potential now lies in joining a team, a tribe, or a bold idea where I can contribute my experience and insights. Even without a formal leadership role, I believe real connections and fostering innovation are still within reach.","
Let’s create a sense of urgency for change—not driven by fear or negativity, but by inspiring each other to build a new global agreement for the future. This starts with the power of one: the individual’s ability to contribute, take action, and lead by example. Together, we can ignite a movement rooted in hope, innovation, and collective responsibility, driving meaningful change for a regenerative world.",,

We live in a time of immense upheaval within the centralized political systems of developed nations. As a U.S. citizen, member of Gen Climate, and young attorney, I hear my generation being challenged to reform our national reliance on governance from Washington, d.c. and the Supreme Court hierarchy. My CTA to Earth One is to embrace our opportunity to reform U.S. democracy by investing in strong mechanisms of local governance, starting in the rural Northeast, and expanding down the east coast. The first mechanisms we are invited to design together relate to governing the elements of life that are most intimate to communities and local ecosystems: their water, agrifood system, natural healthcare system, their housing infrastructure and local business/industries. These elements can/must all arise out of healthy ecosystems, rendering governance according to earth law principles essential. They also can harmoniously arise from proper participation in governance processes according to principles of direct democracy. The Northeast states of VT, ME, NH, NY and CT are fantastic pilot states for local governance infrastructure strategy due to an abundance of wealth; in academia, generating research that now simply needs to be deployed, and in the social sector generating abundant existing local regenerative ag & economy networks, markets, gatherings - through philanthropic and governmental programming alike. All that’s needed is wise coordination across silos. We have the chance to build local governance hubs in partnership with Soil Water Conservation Districts, Tribal Governments, the recent BioFi Bioregional Finance Facility Initiative and existing state initiatives to build climate resilience infrastructure such as Food Hubs and Green Banks.

Infrastructure Limitations: Implementing digital platforms on a national scale requires robust and widespread technological infrastructure. In some countries, limited internet access and outdated technology hinder the deployment and effectiveness of these systems.
Cybersecurity Threats: Ensuring the security of digital democracy platforms is a constant challenge. I need to protect against hacking, data breaches, and cyber-attacks that could compromise the integrity of democratic processes.
Legal and Regulatory Hurdles

Compliance with Diverse Legal Frameworks: Navigating the varying legal systems and regulations of different countries is complex. I must ensure that the platforms comply with national laws, international regulations, and respect for human rights.
Data Privacy Concerns: Balancing transparency with the need to protect individual privacy is challenging. I have to establish protocols that safeguard personal data while promoting open governance.
Cultural and Social Resistance

Resistance to Change: There can be skepticism or reluctance from both government officials and the public to adopt new digital systems. Overcoming ingrained practices and distrust in technology requires persistent effort.
Digital Divide: Socioeconomic disparities lead to unequal access to technology. I face the challenge of making platforms accessible and usable for populations with limited digital literacy or resources.
Political Challenges

Securing Governmental Support: Gaining the endorsement and cooperation of government bodies is crucial. Political agendas, fear of loss of control, or bureaucratic inertia can impede progress.
Policy Alignment: Aligning the functionalities of digital platforms with existing policies and legislative processes requires careful planning and negotiation.
Financial Constraints

Funding Limitations: Developing, deploying, and maintaining national digital platforms is costly. Securing adequate funding from governments, donors, or investors is often a significant hurdle.
Sustainability of Resources: Ensuring long-term financial and operational support for updates, user support, and system maintenance is challenging.
Operational Challenges

Scalability and Performance: Building systems that can handle large user bases without compromising performance is technically demanding. I must ensure reliability and efficiency under high loads.
User Adoption and Engagement: Encouraging widespread adoption and regular use of the platforms requires effective outreach and user experience design that meets diverse needs.
Ethical Considerations

Ensuring Fairness and Inclusivity: Preventing biases in the system and ensuring it serves all demographics equally is essential. I need to be vigilant about the ethical implications of technology deployment.
Combatting Misinformation: Addressing the spread of false information within digital platforms is a persistent challenge that requires proactive measures.
International Collaboration

Standardization and Interoperability: Working towards common standards that allow different countries' systems to interact can be complex. I need to facilitate collaboration while respecting national sovereignty.
Cultural Sensitivity and Localization: Adapting platforms to fit the cultural, linguistic, and social contexts of each country requires thorough understanding and customization.
Education and Capacity Building

Enhancing Digital Literacy: Low levels of digital literacy among citizens can limit the effectiveness of digital democracy tools. I must invest in education and training programs to empower users.
Training for Officials and Administrators: Government officials may lack the necessary skills to manage and utilize new technologies effectively. Providing adequate training is essential for successful implementation.
Technological Evolution

Keeping Pace with Rapid Technological Changes: Technology evolves quickly, and I must ensure that the platforms remain current and secure over time.
Integration with Existing Systems: Integrating new platforms with legacy governmental IT systems poses technical challenges that require careful planning and execution.
Building Trust and Credibility

Establishing Public Trust: Gaining the confidence of citizens that the digital systems are secure, reliable, and beneficial is crucial. Transparency in operations and clear communication are key.
Transparency in Algorithms and Processes: I need to be open about how the systems work, including data usage and decision-making processes, to build legitimacy and acceptance.
By recognizing and proactively addressing these challenges, I strive to create digital democracy systems that are secure, inclusive, and effective. Overcoming these obstacles is integral to fostering democratic values and advancing towards more transparent and participatory governance worldwide.","

I spent my former career (14 years) telling the stories of the slave trade from a maritime archeological lens, created a non-profit that is still going 13 years later focused on youth education and public outreach within maritime archaeology, worked on coral reef restoration in the Keys, worked on sunken WWII Tuskegee aircrafts, and also was combating the illegal looting of antiquities in the Middle East. So at my heart I am a storyteller. All while doing these things, I was heavily involved in community development with the various stakeholders in that world which has evolved now to community building. My niche and function now is to bring heart into impact and creating connection. My superpower is to create whole-hearted love through my experience design, storytelling, and community leadership. I now get to bring products like Mozi to our world which helps people see the people that they care about more often with an app that does the legwork for them. Bringing products and tools into the ether that make our lives more connected while making our lives easier (with trust and privacy as pillars) is such a dream come true.","
getting network effect - my love and my communities are my capital and the biggest challenge is finding the edges of those and how to continue to scale past them while still maintaining integrity (and personal nourishment).","
CTA is to help us all love more genuinely from a place of authenticity. And from a product standpoint, to help me get our ship + extended networks/communities on Mozi so we can continue to see one another with ease all over the world and make real lasting IRL connections.",,
Jyoti Ma,https://earthone.world/alliance/jyoti-ma,"the Fountain for Natural Order of Our Existence
the Mother Earth Delegation of United Original Nations","FOUNDER OF THE FOUNTAIN FOR NATURAL ORDER OF OUR EXISTENCE
DELEGATE ON THE MOTHER EARTH DELEGATION OF UNITED ORIGINAL NATIONS","Guerneville, Californai USA",https://thefountain.earth,,,,"Jyoti Ma is an internationally renowned spiritual teacher. She has cultivated projects that demonstrate ways of life that honor the Earth and all Peoples. As the Grandmother Vision Keeper of the Center for Sacred Studies (centerforsacredstudies.org), she co-founded Kayumari with spiritual communities both in America and Europe. Other projects she has helped to convene are the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers and the Unity Concert. She is the founder of The Fountain (https://thefountain.earth) It’s mission is to restore an economic model that is based on reciprocity and collaboration guided by Nature and the Sacred. Currently, as a delegate of the Mother Earth Delegation of United Original Nations a collaboration with the Fountain has grown, creating a global movement for and with the Earth that is ready to activate the New Day.","
In my world, change is brought through following the direction of the Original Peoples, and in service to prophecy and the instruction it is bringing to these times.  An example is the direction the Mother Earth is currently bringing to us through the Kogi Peoples of South America. She has given us a formula for healing--she is having us restore a 9 part broken body through acquiring land trusts, so that the land can be returned to the Kogi. As we enter each part of this body, we follow the original principles of that territory, so that the foundation for the restoration of the ecology and the culture are initiated. We have done 3 parts so far, and are just beginning the fourth. They say the first was the head--the memory. The second was the ears--sound. The third was the eyes--the light. The fourth will be the mouth --connection. Once this body is fully restored, the Kogi say that a healing for sacred territories will be felt globally. As this is occurring, pagamentos (earth payments) are being done. These payments are called for by Mother Earth and occur in different places around the planet. This has most recently happened in Greenland, Iceland, and along the Black Line in the La Sierra Nevada of Colombia. This Black Line connects all the sacred territories of the Arhuaco, Kankuamo, Kogi and Wiwa.  This work also takes them to sacred sites, so they can restore balance. The Fountain has been built through the instruction of the Mamos of the Kogi, Arhuaco and the Wiwa over this last 12 years. It is this deep study in Mother Law and Nature's original way of life that I bring to this table. I am grateful for the almost 40 years of teaching and initiation that the elders have brought to me and my community. I am grateful for the deep relations that have formed over these years with elders both in the Mother Earth Delegation and other elders globally. I am grateful for the teachings of our plant medicines and the earth protocols they awakened in us. And as a grandmother, I am grateful to be finding others that have been called and are walking the New Dawn!!!!","
The biggest challenge is finding those that are ready to share resources to fill what I call the Mother Pond. If that pond is full, then when the elders receive instruction from Mother Earth, we can immediately flow the resources that will allow that work to unfold in a timely way. When this flow is established, then we will have returned to Mother Law rather than Man made Law. As this flow supports our Original Peoples on the ground, reciprocity for the root cultures is regenerated. Another challenge is finding the resources to support the small staff that are holding all this work.","
The Kogi brought a message to us in October of last year. It has now gone viral. It is called Mother's Message. You can view it on the Fountain website. In this message she says we have two more years to make a choice. She says she can no longer carry the maladies we have put upon her and are still putting on her. She must begin her healing process as her ascension process pulls her. We have two choices. We can support her original peoples--her original caretakers as they receive the instructions to her healing. Or she will have to take her healing into her own hands. That will be more severe upon humanity. So she is shouting out--Please wake to the moment of choice humanity is in. As this message went viral, many many elders globally shared how they are receiving the same timing. That for generations they knew of these prophetic times of transformation, and these times are here now!!! The call to action is for creative collaboration and spiritually directed movements that honor all life as sacred. A moment where the impossible is possible. Where the heart is lighting our way. Where we can deeply listen and be the New Dawn walking.",NEW ECONOMIES,FELLOW

My niche lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and healthcare, specifically in the fight against cancer.
History often recounts tales of conquests—how kings fought for gold, land, spices, and, ultimately, for human greed. But to defeat cancer, we’ll need to stand next to each other, not against each other. We can’t afford to overlook any patient’s journey because each stage of treatment, every response, and outcome holds crucial insights. By uniting these experiences, we can transform individual struggles into shared strength, leading to better treatments for everyone.
One of my proudest achievements was reviving and completing a project at Standard Chartered that had been stalled for 7 years and considered impossible. I collaborated with teams from over 30 countries to bring it to fruition, earning a reputation for solving what others deemed unsolvable.
The Earth One community can learn from me about the potential of Artificial Intelligence in medicine—why it has thrived in many sectors but still faces challenges in healthcare, and how we can overcome these barriers together. I can share insights on how we can revolutionise the fight against cancer and collaborate to solve the most pressing medical challenges.","
One of the biggest barriers I’ve encountered in my mission to collect global cancer patient data is the deep-seated distrust people often have for one another, particularly across borders. To truly fight a common enemy like cancer, we must unite and collaborate. My goal is to create the largest and most comprehensive dataset ever assembled, one that learns from the lives of all cancer patients—past, present, and future. However, I've found that hesitations and reservations between people from different countries can stifle collaboration. I believe the Earth One community can play a pivotal role in helping me overcome this challenge, fostering trust and cooperation that transcends national boundaries.","
I call on the Earth One community to join forces in breaking down barriers of mistrust and isolation in cancer research. Let’s build a global coalition dedicated to sharing knowledge and resources. We need to ensure that every country, regardless of its resources, can participate and contribute valuable data to the global fight against cancer. By supporting infrastructure and capacity-building initiatives, we can empower developing regions to become key players in advancing cancer treatment for all.",,

Attunement with the natural rhythms and cycles is paramount and optimal for our next chapter of humanity.  I approach with understanding the social mechanics and synarchic efficiency that occurs when human are living in their most aligned state.  In the ecosystem of regenerrosity, where every step is made from the place of offering of that unique frequency, the reciprocal result is in obvious benefit to the whole.  We are templating academy based attunement centers mixed used residential, retreat immersive educational models that align the human vessel through embodiment mastery, exploration consciousness through relational dynamics, modeling regenerative agriculture and food security, applied synarchy based governance and holos, wisdom and esoteric sciences, expressive arts and focus on the fundamental basics of our evolving human nature.  Our approach is in addressing the extractive models of wellness from host communities by offering inclusive wellness where the local communities receive the respect and reverence and return for the roots of the culture that have allowed for our community evolution.  We envision cocreation circular economic empowerment through the modeling of those principles in every step of the journey.  

We’re currently exploring relatios with the new administration of Indonesia to see how me can template a wellness development model that can be adapted to state owned hospitality that will be liquidated into private ownership.  

The message is clear that there are multiple nodes which are fertile at this time where similar templates would be easily implemented, the communities are ready and hungry to mobilize and creating councils that can implement the templates, gather in coherence and activate these nodes with infusions of capital to begin identifying key nodal points within the global network that become transmission centers.  The goal would ultimately be to start at large fund for the development of these projects and to have a council to review and discuss where the funds would be directed.","
To date funding has been the largest challenge to support the teams necessary for feasibility master planning and dedicated members who are at the top of their game to implement at the level this scaled needs to be.  We’ve been clear that the community based revenue models that continually inject capital into the surrounding local community is imperative.","

One of the biggest challenges I face is the crisis of identity. By this, I mean that people and leaders often define what is moral and just based on their own identities, backgrounds, and cultures. For example, do people in the Arab region feel the pain of Israelis as deeply as they do for Palestinians? Do Europeans empathize with Ukrainians in the same way they do with Palestinians? This identity-based moral divide presents a significant obstacle to effective leadership and global cooperation.

I believe in a world where all human lives are treated equally, regardless of identity, culture, or religion. I envision a world where our identities do not blind us to the injustices and suffering of others. This is why I consider the crisis of identity to be my greatest challenge—it influences every aspect of my work with partners and groups striving to stop violence and make the world peaceful. It impacts how global institutions, donors, the UN, and other entities decide whether to care or not to care. To act or to remain silent in the face of injustice.","
My call to action for the Earth One community is to join me in restructuring the global governance system, which is currently based on power and identities, to make it stronger, more equitable, and fit for purpose. Together, we can challenge the systems and structures that allow identity and nation-based interests to dictate who is cared for and who is neglected. I invite the community to collaborate on creating inclusive frameworks for a new global order—one that is inclusive and capable of addressing the 21st century challenges.",,

I have spent 20 years exploring broken economic systems, starting from the ground up (refugee camps and the agencies that serve them), moving into the middle layer (building the largest bartering system in the world run by a virtual currency to allow those left out of the traditional economic system an opportunity for prosperity, and ultimately now disrupting the most traditional systems of capital and power from the inside out via working to prove that you can do even private equity in an ethical, human-centric way.  

My theories of change have evolved greatly over the years, at times focused on the most bottom-up and at times on the most top-down. I have been a thought leader in the social entrepreneurship & international development space, a thought leader in the alternative economies/currencies space as a Top Writer in Technology on Medium (for example, https://medium.com/public-market/the-future-of-network-effects-tokenization-and-the-end-of-extraction-a0f895639ffb), and now am approaching PE and alternative acquisitions in a heart-centered way (see: https://www.ft.com/content/7eaa42f1-6301-45e3-8468-2e22e666cf11 and https://arisingventures.notion.site/10-Principles-High-Performance-With-Heart-b24c8b3691674ef3a8c02933510bb9c3). 

My academic training is in Economics & Public Policy (BA, Stanford) and Social Entrepreneurship & Finance (Skoll Scholarship, Oxford MBA). My thesis was a regression analysis of the variables impacting the cycles of conflict on the African continent, exploring the inextricable ties between economic well-being and the ability of a country to maintain peace after war (spoiler alert: in countries with a history of instability, average rainfall levels dropping just 10% leads to a 50% increase in the probability of a new conflict cycle).  As a Guidestar fellow, I've also done deep philosophical work on theories of change in philanthropy, have led campaigns redefining the importance of overhead spend in nonprofits (The Overhead Myth Campaign, 2013), and built products to educate donors on how to align their giving with their highest values. 

I would bring these diverse experiences and viewpoints to the Crossing, hopefully helping to establish a holistic understanding of issues faced at all levels of our global economic system.","

At reNourish Studio and in collaboration with communities that we work with such as The Regenesis Institute for Regenerative Practice, we are working on these questions. I am curious to work on these with new collaborators aboard the Earth One ship. In order for businesses to evolve from being extractive to engaging in a process of regeneration, we need to not only evolve the way we think and our business strategies, but we also need to evolve key infrastructure so that it enables the process of regeneration. Additionally, it is critical that each unique place on the planet engages in a process of place-sourced essence expression in order to evolve its potential. I think that storytelling and the stories that we are telling all over the planet are going to be very important to generate interest for businesses and communities to engage in a process of regeneration.  Storytelling will be key in the transition from seeing the world as a machine to engaging with it as a living process, and unleashing the unique creativity of whole communities and all the individuals who live there instead of simply a few visionary leaders.

The essence of my work is the deep commitment to solving one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time—plastic pollution in our oceans. I believe that human health and ocean health are intrinsically connected. Over the years, I’ve founded and led multiple social enterprises and nonprofits, like the Hong Kong Cleanup, which has mobilized millions of volunteers and removed over 11 million kilograms of trash from our environment.

At the core of my theory of change is the belief that raising human consciousness is key to creating lasting solutions for environmental problems. I believe that by empowering individuals and organizations to take responsibility, fostering collaboration, and spreading awareness, we can accelerate change at scale. It’s about aligning personal well-being with planetary well-being, so people understand that healing the earth heals ourselves.

What matters most for all of us to understand is that we are at a critical tipping point. The health of our oceans directly impacts the future of humanity. We need to shift from treating symptoms to addressing root causes. Education, engagement, and systemic changes are crucial. Whether it's reducing plastic use, supporting sustainable systems, or fostering community-led cleanups, every individual action adds up to a collective impact.","
The greatest challenge I face in this work is scaling our efforts to match the urgency and scale of the problem. While we have made incredible progress in raising awareness and mobilizing volunteers, the environmental crisis we face is growing faster than our current solutions. We need to build global, interconnected systems that prioritize sustainability, and this requires more than individual actions—it requires systemic change at all levels of society, and I believe that technology can play a major role..","
My invitation to the Earth One Alliance is to help amplify the message of interconnectedness and drive forward the movement of raising human consciousness. This could be through forming partnerships, in this age of collaboration that integrate ocean and environmental health with holistic well-being, creating platforms for education and outreach, or leveraging our networks to inspire leaders in other sectors to prioritize sustainable action.

Together, we can co-create systems where humanity thrives in harmony with the planet, where the health of our oceans is protected, and where future generations can live in a world free from the devastation of plastic pollution. Let’s build that future together.",OCEAN,FELLOW

Right now, funding. We have a 10 year strategy and all the diverse partners, institutions and all projects in place. We need funding to start all the wheels turning.","
My call to action to the Earth One community is to lift the lid on how mainstream institutional approaches to environment like ocean governance and wildlife conservation contain within them the same thinking which have created the problem. We need to slow down and stay critical— always looking at the longer origins of specific ideas and agendas. It is an emergency but we can not afford to lose more time propping up old ideas in a new dressing. 
 Many of us are working with transversal issues that touch down in specific sector areas, but are really much bigger and interconnected. Another call to action is building powerful momentum through functional and meaningful modes of weaving together and amplification. With so many incredible initiatives out there there is the challenge to cross pollinate them vertically and horizontally in ways that can actually move big waves of change.",OCEAN,FELLOW

My unique skill is helping people find better solutions together than they would have separately and bridge divides. 

I have done this across many sectors including with politicians, families, and sustainability. I am passionate about facilitating conversations that lead to powerful change in the world. 

I've had a chat with Samuel Aspen Kern about a few options of events or workshop-style things that I could offer - including helping people have better conversations and bridge differences on election-night. Helping people who are struggling and want to bridge any divides on board. Running an event on having better conversations/ difficult conversations etc. If it helps, to understand better what I do, I've worked on this series for UCL on Disagreeing Well: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/about/disagreeing-well/resources/disagreeing-well-skills-video-series

A storyteller at the core, Monica Dogra dons several avatars, connected by the aim of opening hearts and minds to make space for uniquely diverse expressions of the human experience.
The daughter of Kashmiri immigrants, Monica Dogra was raised in Maryland and grew up listening to Hindu devotional songs, ghazals, and Bollywood hits of Lata Mangeshkar. At age 16, she won a competition and debuted at Carnegie Hall, went on to graduate from NYU’s prestigious music performance program, appeared in the New York Theatre Circuit in plays and musicals and eventually found herself in India, while recording a solo-project with Andre Bettes in New York City, the
producer of Madonna’s Immaculate Collection.
As a musician, she has released a total of 6 studio albums, with two of her recent singles charting on Apple Music Top 10 on the Dance Charts in India. She has forayed into the medicine music space, releasing her first medicine song with international
legends Mose and Franko Heke in June 2021.
She now tours with her sacred concert series, Nākaloka, with music partner Victorien Mulliez, in epic venues like The Tibet House (NYC), The College of Extraordinary Experiences (Poland), Esalen (CA).

This knowledge has been under brutal attack, with attempted genocide, and supremacies of every kind. I would much rather that my grandparents and great grandparents were attending this meeting, with the Thrivng Life Paradigm, the knowledge, the prayer intact, but in their lifetime, their voice could not, would not, be heard.

Anthropocentrism. A large part of my work is re-proposing that we, the five fingered ones, rest within a very large community of life. All of the members of the sacred hoop of life around us have knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence about how to be moving in concert as single organism called earth. Cultures who have had true sustainability, that is, living in place in relative health, harmony and happiness for 1000 years or 5000 years or 10,000 years or 20,000 years, have considered the community of life as teachers and had practices to make inquiry and receive teaching. Most of these successful cultures of sustainability also acknowledged a spiritual realm and received guidance and direction from that community as well. Additionally, the larger community also includes Cosmos and human beings have contributed and participated in this conversation between earth and cosmos, as part of our function, and raison d'être since time  immemorial. Much of this understanding and methodology is forgotten - and not by accident. Much of solution finding does not acknowledge these practices that have given us any previous success we might have had. It is time that they be remembered reproposed and reconsidered.","
My first call to action would be to have whatever endeavor you come out of here with to include how it will preserve or not further decimate and destroy the human library of understanding of how to be a thriving life presence on the planet, which is contained within indigenous, language, culture, and relationship to place.

We need to move hundreds of billions of dollars from those causing the climate crisis to those solving it.  At Carbon Growth Partners we've made a start; in the past 3 years alone we have directed more than $200 million to climate projects in the global South.  Waste infrastrcture in Senegal, mangrove restoration in Pakistan and Mexico, safe cooking in Malawi, DRC, Zambia and Ghana, forest conseravtion in Colombia and Brazil, clean energy in India and Uganda, methane recovery in Bangladesh and more.   We know how to do this - not perfectly, and never alone.  But with the right partners, we CAN do this.","
The biggest challenge when trying to solve the most existential crisis in human history - it's tricky to choose just one.  There's human psychology and evolutionary biology, apathy, entrenched interests, misinformation, political reality, soacila injustice, perverse incentives...  But let's go for one that's solvable: leadership.  Not government leadership, that's proven to be a bridge too far.  Not individual leadership, that's vital but we need scale.  But corporate leadership.  We need to create the behavioural norm that it is morally, reputationally and commercially unacceptable to continue to pollute the atmosphere for free, even if it permitted by law.  How?","
Solving the climate crisis is actually not hard.  We need to every influence every CEO of every company to commit to balancing their carbon books, by taking two simple actions:
1. REDUCE their company's emissions to the extent possible 
2. INVEST in market-based solutions to offset what's left 

Buisness - like life - is better when it's balance: a credit for every debit, equal and opposite.  Every tonne, every time.   Help us make that case, tell better stories, reach the folks we need to reach and persuade them to do what's right.",,

This process requires the active and responsible engagement of our consciousness with the Original Instructions at the individual and collective levels.

A practical means for humanity to remember and live according to the Original Instructions, is through the implementation of the Four Earth Mandates Program.

My theory of change is that at these times of transition and eventual collapse, we need to protect as much biocultural diversity as possible. This means being strategic tapping into good data like the Global Safety Net science, partnering with frontline communities keeping forests and cultures alive, and aligning business action so our supply chains are in service of this work. 
A big part of the work is narrative and storytelling so we can bring culture along and create connection. 

I have been involved in corporate regenerative leadership and the development of regenerative supply webs, philanthropy strategies to flow money in service of life and the development of programmes in partnerships with Global South organisations.","
With the non-profits I help steward the right kind of strategic, catalytic funding is crucial. Moving money to the edges, trusting that communities in threatened or degraded landscapes know best how to evolve their bioregions.

We are starting a two year programme in Brazil and all organisations are struggling with access to water, even the ones in the Amazon! Scaling capacity and resources for water retention landscapes, sponge villages, etc is important resilience against climate impacts and nature loss.

two decades, I have been deeply immersed in Ken Wilber's integral community, absorbing, synthesizing, and expanding upon the transformative ideas that form the foundation of integral theory. This extensive experience has positioned me as a leader in the movement towards envisioning and creating a second-tier society.
My accidental Satori experience at 19 was the catalyst that set me on this path of cosmic alignment. Since then, I have dedicated my life to the grand vision of manifesting ""heaven on earth"" - not as an abstract ideal, but as a tangible, ever-expanding Commonwealth of peace, prosperity, and well-being for all.
Through my work with visionaries like Ken Wilber, Jean Houston, Marianne Williamson, and many others, I have honed my abilities as a strategist, advisor, and catalyst for change. I have developed a unique capacity to synthesize diverse fields of knowledge - from integral theory and spiritual wisdom to cutting-edge technologies and economic strategies - into a holistic vision for our collective future.
Now, after years of learning, growing, and building relationships, I find myself at the forefront of a movement that seeks to fundamentally transform our world. I am working tirelessly, often behind the scenes and in stealth, to forge partnerships and cultivate ideas that have the potential to shift our global paradigm.
My mission extends beyond mere theory or philosophy. I am actively engaged in developing practical, implementable strategies that can bring about the systemic changes our world so desperately needs. From digital communications and AI tools to regenerative design and economic restructuring, I am exploring every avenue that could contribute to our collective evolution.
The network I have built over the years is a powerful force for change. Together with other visionary thinkers and doers, we are quietly laying the groundwork for a societal transformation of unprecedented scale. Our goal is nothing less than the creation of a world that works for all, without harm or injustice.
As I continue this work, I remain deeply committed to the power of hope. I believe that hope is not just a feeling, but a force - a catalyst for action and a beacon guiding us towards our highest potential. Even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, I hold fast to the vision of what is possible when we align our efforts with the cosmic design.
The projects I'm currently developing in secret hold the potential to accelerate our progress towards a more integrated, compassionate, and sustainable world. While I cannot divulge the details yet, I can say that they represent the culmination of years of study, collaboration, and visionary thinking.
As a leader in the integral movement and a champion for second-tier consciousness, I am more committed than ever to the great work of our time. I invite all who resonate with this vision to join us in this cosmic dance of transformation. Together, we can create the future we know is possible - a future where heaven on earth is not just a dream, but a living reality.","

My current work is focused on the healing economy: helping scale organizations that promote human flourishing and protect the planet. The work is both personal and systemic.
I serve as an advisor, investor and collaborator.","
I am experienced CEO and entrepreneur who also focuses time on using my foundation to reduce trauma and suffering in all of its forms. I believe that access to systemic solutions will emerge as we reduce both and return to a culture of care.","
Interesting people and ideas to collaborate with to help people see through their trauma-based false self narratives, so we can allow for partial altruism and re-emergence of a society of care.","
I am partial to action over words and seek partners who want to cause results in the world.",,

Over the last 12 years, in her role as SVP of Climate Tech and Executive Director of VERGE with GreenBiz, Shana helped build and scale VERGE into the leading climate tech event accelerating solutions to the most pressing challenges of our time. VERGE is the center of gravity for the climate community — convening thousands of leaders from business, government, solution providers and startups — working together to accelerate systemic solutions to the climate crisis and ensure a just transition to a clean economy.
Shana previously served as the Director of Education for Bioneers, and as a nationally recognized community leader and organizer during her time as an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Southern California.
Outside of her work with GreenBiz, Shana is a sought after public speaker, moderator and facilitator around sustainability and systems change.

- Climate tech — after spending the last 12 years building and leading the largest climate tech solutions event in North America
- Convenings — both intimate and at scale
- Design and facilitation — towards focused and transformational goals
- Intersectional and systemic approaches to environmental and social progress
- Writing and performing songs that anchor hope in a more ecologically thriving, socially just world!","

I work to realize this vision by creating collaborative environments and systems with my decentralized permaculture-action nonprofit, Permatours, and by providing unrestricted grants to grassroots change-makers (""Flow Funders"") through Kinship Earth Flow Fund. Flow Funders are entrusted to deploy the funds they receive based on the specific needs of their communities.","
I co-created a non-profit and permaculture-action community called Permatours, which operates with a rotating leadership model inspired by decentralized autonomous organizational models. Over the past 3.5 years, the community has grown to include 11 dedicated team members, including community organizers, engineers, permaculturists, farmers, natural building-focused contractors, homesteaders, makers, and more. Through our educational events and learn-by-doing projects, we have created a network that spans over 40 land-based communities located throughout the Forests of the Northeast Bioregion and beyond, engaging thousands of participants.

I have witnessed firsthand the power of a model that inspires action and collaboration, and encourages everyone to step into leadership roles. Permatours has achieved remarkable outcomes with minimal financial resources, as we operate without a traditional “boss” or hierarchy. Leadership rotates per project or per time served in a specific role. We collectively take responsibility and create pathways for newcomers to learn and lead projects. To date, Permatours has received ~ $40K in grants and donations. Our projects are carried out by impassioned souls and curious minds driven to learn, heal, co-create, and contribute to something larger than themselves. 

Guided by the permaculture ethics of Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share, Permatours also draws inspiration from the famous Rainbow gathering, where everyone is welcomed and loved. At Rainbow and at Permatours events, all are embraced and all are “home,” because the Earth is our shared home. We frequently receive feedback highlighting the transformational impact these events have on participants, strengthening the “family” we’ve built and enhancing our capacity to support land-based communities, while teaching people the skills to survive and thrive.

My personal strengths lie in community building, and creating spaces that invite people to authentically express themselves, to try new things, to co-create, and to heal. 

I am also experienced in the areas of communication, organizing, presenting, public speaking, facilitating, moderating, and mediating, which I apply to create meaningful change in the world. 

The challenges Permatours has faced with fundraising and securing grants have ignited my passion for increasing grassroots initiatives’ access to resources.  This passion led me to my current role as Executive Director of Kinship Earth Flow Fund. 

In this role, I raise funds to provide unrestricted grants to grassroots change-makers (“Flow Funders”), who are trusted to deploy the resources they receive according to the needs of their communities and to maximize positive impact. Unlike traditional philanthropy, Flow Funding does not require grant applications or extensive reports. Instead, we simply ask Flow Funders to share their impact stories, with all forms of media accepted.  Additionally, my work involves educating foundations, charities, individual donors, and groups organizing around their bioregions on how to create their own Flow Funds and Flow Funding ecosystems.","
1) Kinship Earth Flow Fund lacks diversity on its board. We are actively seeking new board members, particularly those who can represent and reflect the needs of the communities we aim to resource. 

2) Many of the grassroots organizers I work with are struggling to meet their basic needs, which has led to burnout for many of them. My mission is to secure resources that will fund their work, and support their thriveability.

3) As the first (and only) employee at Kinship Earth Flow Fund, I juggle many responsibilities. Our largest donor has mandated that the majority of the funds we received from them go directly to grassroots change-makers (“Flow Funders”), which means there are minimal resources for operational and educational purposes - specifically education around expanding the adoption of Flow Funding globally. I am actively raising funds to address these challenges, and to bring on additional support.


4) At Permatours, our team members are either volunteers or they receive small stipends for their work, which limits our collective capacity for fundraising. Therefore, I am raising funds to keep “the tour” going and to launch: 
-PermaTokens: A community created and governed currency designed to cultivate a regenerative circular economy amongst the many land-based projects we serve (and the communities they serve), thereby reducing our collective dependency on fiat.
-The Skilled Guild: A network of our community’s earth-conscious laborers, contractors, practitioners, makers, farmers, artists & others who are available for hire.
-Permatours Chapters: Enabling groups around the world to spin up their own community-driven permaculture action projects by open sourcing Permatours’ resources, processes, infrastructure, software, online presence, & more, while our current team provides support on an as-needed basis.
-Permatours' Bioregional Learning Center: An educational hub for gathering and synthesizing knowledge about local ecology and culture; serving holistic landscape restoration at the local level; fostering integration and cooperation toward regenerative goals; helping local communities see themselves as part of living ecosystems.","
My call to action is an invitation to connect with like-minded individuals, to exchange insights that propel our initiatives forward, and to brainstorm ways we can collaborate to advance our shared goals.

I’m particularly eager to meet funders who are open to exploring how they can play a role in large-scale planetary regeneration and healing, including through trusting, and sharing power and resources with those who are closest to the needs of their communities.

Additionally, I would love to participate in think tanks and circles that foster ideation, heart-centered sharing, and deep listening, with the aim of catalyzing real solutions to pressing global challenges like climate change, poverty, war, ecosystem and human health, and destructive industrial complexes.",NEW ECONOMIES,FELLOW

1) Join Heal the Bay in building a new, world-class, sustainable and ethical aquarium and education facility on top of the Santa Monica Pier to allow members of the community and the millions of people who visit the pier each year to fall in love with the ocean and all the amazing marine life that call it home and then give them to the tools to help protect it. The aquarium will also be home to an aquaculture lab and workforce development program, where students can learn how to ethically grow food and repopulate endangered species. 

2) Heal the Bay just filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil for its role in creating the plastic pollution crisis alongside the California Attorney General and a coalition of partner organizations. Help draw attention to the harms of single-use plastics and get ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies to change their harmful practices. 

3) Los Angeles will be home to the 2028 Olympics and I serve on the LA28 Olympic Sustainability Committee. I'd love ideas for ways to highlight innovation around sustainability, especially through art and culture, while LA is on the world stage.",OCEAN,FELLOW

My theory of change centers on the transformative power of women connecting with nature and each other. I believe that when women engage in outdoor experiences, they not only strengthen their leadership skills but also foster resilience, collaboration, and empathy. Nature serves as a powerful backdrop for personal growth and community building, encouraging women to step into their leadership roles with confidence.

My unique skill lies in facilitating these transformative experiences. With a background in sports and education, I've successfully led multicultural wilderness expeditions that empower women to discover their strength and voice in a supportive environment. 

Our community can learn the importance of inclusivity and cooperation in leadership. By creating spaces where women from diverse backgrounds can unite in nature, we cultivate a sense of shared purpose and inspire collective action. Together, we can harness our strengths to drive positive change, promoting peace and understanding in our communities.","
The biggest challenges I face in my work to achieve my mission are securing adequate financial resources and overcoming systemic barriers to participation. Funding is essential for organizing outdoor programs and expeditions that empower women and promote coexistence. Limited financial support restricts our ability to reach a wider audience and implement impactful initiatives.

Additionally, addressing logistical barriers—such as transportation and access to resources—can hinder participation from underrepresented communities. Ensuring that all women have the opportunity to engage in these transformative experiences is crucial for fostering leadership and building connections.

To overcome these challenges, I focus on building partnerships with organizations that share our vision and seek innovative funding solutions, including grants and community sponsorships. By strengthening our network and advocating for inclusivity, we can enhance our programs and drive meaningful change.","
Our call for action is to support ULFA in Empowering Palestinians and Israelis Women Leaders! Together, we can create an impactful program that connects women in Palestine and Israel to nature, enhancing their leadership skills. By leveraging the Earth One Community’s resources and networks, we can facilitate mentorship opportunities, create enriching learning experiences, and implement effective knowledge management and resource-sharing strategies.

Now performing under his own name, Victorien offers multifaceted and uplifting sets. As a DJ, he has played at some of the world's largest music festivals, including Coachella and Tomorrowland. His global tours have involved engaging with local communities and collaborating with remote tribes. Victorien has for many years worked with Daybreaker and is currently working as a Lead Producer for the “Party To The Polls” Purple Tour, a non-partisan action inviting civic action around the US.
Victorien has long aspired to transform the world around him. As a passionate New Yorker concerned about plastic pollution, he co-created LitterRally, the most epic trash pick-up dance party. This event gathered many to clean the streets of the Big Apple while weaving educational content and artistic performances.
During the pandemic, while in Bali, Victorien witnessed rising poverty and food scarcity. In response, he started food distribution efforts but soon realized a more sustainable solution was needed. He co-created BALI LIVE, two online fundraiser festivals featuring artists from around the world. Partnering with the NGO Kopernik, they raised $50,000, funding two distinct projects: a community urban garden initiative (now expanding across Indonesia) and a campaign to educate local farmers on sustainable fertilizers and fair distribution of their surplus during COVID-19.
A student of sound and soul, Victorien's mission is to create uplifting and transformative experiences through the sound of world flutes, inspiring joy and peace. He sees in Nākaloka a deep passion and a new potential to further carry his mission.

Will Grant,https://earthone.world/alliance/will-grant,Pachamama Alliance,DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY ACTION AND STRATEGY,"San Anselmo, California, USA",www.pachamama.org,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-grant-74a714111/,,,"
I convene global innovators creating systemic change in a broad array of fields - including economics, politics, regeneration, education, identity and spirituality. 
Integrating diverse paradigms generates innovation. I bring people together across cultures and worldviews - indigenous and modern, Global North and Global South - and across systems - social movements and corporations, government and private sector - to create coalitions for strategic action.

I have six main tools 
Collective systems thinking to find emergent forces and leverage points 
Facilitation through complex dialogs into clear action steps
Organizational development that integrates the personal, team, and organizational capacity needed to succeed with new innovations   
Conflict resolution, especially across historic divides 
Education and instructional design as the practice of liberation 
Listening for guidance from Spirit 
Story telling for transformation - creating narratives and experienced that communicate new paradigms 

At Pachamama Alliance, I have a strong focus on climate solutions as a path for people to see the full scope of the meta crisis and then realize that humans can redesign our global systems into a just, regenerative, sacred world. Pachamama Alliance works at both the systemic level and the grassroots. In June we held a gathering of global leaders to analyze how we could move the world from human supremacy to sacred reciprocity. We are in an on-going process of mapping the meta-crisis to find leverage points for change. At the grassroots level, I designed a training system for community action that has launched 130 climate justice projects in 7 countries. 

I am passionate about humans remembering that we co-create the world with each other and the more-than-human communities we share life with: nature, Earth, spirits and Spirit. We can co-design and co-create the world we want. I love working for systemic change with an analytical, gritty understanding of power combined with a deep sense of the interconnection of everything and the reality that we will be guided as we learn to listen.  

I have spent my life living, learning and collaborating in diverse cultures from Japan to the Navajo Nation to Queer communities. Every community has ways to foster empowerment and leadership for collective development, healthy cultures, intelligent systems, and wise decision making. Working with and learning from state legislators, undocumented immigrants, youth activists, Federal judges and African revolutionaries (to name a few) has taught me how to see the world from many different perspectives.

I offer all of these experiences in my work - and for my communities -  to catalyze successful change, integrating the structural with the personal, the emotional with the intellectual, the spiritual with the strategic.","
I am always looking for people who have successfully shifted organizations and systems into new paradigms. 

A core question is how to track and evaluate paradigm changes through the twisting, complex, non-linear process of adaptive growth. 

How do movements learn to learn - to integrate data and feeling to understand when they are making progress in the right direction, to course correct when they are not, to dialog about multiple experiences of the process so they can come to alignment? 

How have people seen communities, leaders, and organizations come together to listen for guidance from other intelligences - from science and spirituality to indigenous knowledge - especially when the communities come from diverse religious backgrounds and the guidance comes from sources they are not used to listening to - or even believing they exist? 

All of these are versions of the question - how do collectives become self reflectively aware of their growth?","
Pachamama Alliance’s mission is to change the Dream of the Modern World - to move us from cultures of Human Supremacy to realizing the sacred interconnection of everything. To change the direction of the meta-crisis, we have to change the core mindset that has created it - the belief in human supremacy and the myth that we exist in separation. Without that shift in consciousness, we can solve the current crises but will have 5 more emerge as humans devour, poison, and monetize the world. A reason we are joining The Atlantic Crossing is because this community is aiming to integrate the ocean of solutions already available into new global systems. Pachamama Alliance’s inquiry is in how to support people creating systemic solutions by offering our experience shifting mindsets and core paradigms. Our CTA is to ask you - how can we be of service to your work and strategies?",,
